# Greetings! 
My name is Ryu Jiyoon(한글명 : 류지윤) (formerly Ryu Dongsoo). 

I have recently been studying web development, specifically Spring, a Java backend framework 

and also the frontend framework React. 


My last job mainly involved writing SQL queries in Oracle and developing frontend logic with Vue.js. 

Currently, I am mainly focused on studying Java concurrency programming and writing database queries in Oracle.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and plan to write articles about them on my blog.
